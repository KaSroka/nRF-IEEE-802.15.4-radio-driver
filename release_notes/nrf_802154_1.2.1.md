# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.2.1 release notes

# TODO
Release date: 2018-09-??
# TODO

This is a minor release with bugfixes.

## Bug fixes:
* Fix build with CSMA-CA disabled. ([PR #154](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/154))
* Preserve RTC interrupt status while leaving critical sections. ([PR #155](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/155))


## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* (inherited) In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of SoftDevice Front-End and 802.15.4 Front-End:
* PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice (17, 18, 19) should not be used.
* SoftDevice and 802.15.4 driver should use separate sets of PPI channels, i.e. (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* SoftDevice and 802.15.4 driver should use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, i.e. 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* (inherited) Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
